# The sloped keyboard by koreem ahmed 

## Total time 22-31

## Day 1 (3-4 hours) 8/7/2025
Today I began my search about the key-board and how to make it and the switches types and all the components of the key-board. I searched on ram electronics and flux (local stores in Egypt) and i found such a large amount of diffrent component which i can use in my keyboard i found alot of micro controllers but i chosed the pico due to its high speed and its easy way in flashing the code on it. I found that the perfect size for me is 75% key-boards to fit on my desk and be easy to be moved around. since i am in a board school so every week i will going to school in the first of the week adnd returning home in the end of the week so i made a small keyboard that can be carried easly. so i made the layout on key-layout editor and got the dxf file which i will use in making the top part of my cad then i contenued planing for what i want to do. like having oled displays or rgps or rottry endecators.

## Day 2 (2-3 hours) 10/7/2025
I made a deep search of the most compatible libraries for kicad for the OLED display which must have 4 pins for (vcc , gnd , SDA , SCL) and the pico to match the exact same model i choosed on the flux the onlune local store in egypt and the switches to have the perfect size and to have the staplizers needed then I downloaded all of them and start making the scheamtic and i am half way through. in the schematic i made the key matrix and some of the pico pins like the 16 coloumns and 6 rows for my 75% keyboard. also i searched for the best 3d files to represent my work in the right way to be able to put it in the cad files.

## Day 3 (3-4 hours) 12/7/2025
I completed the schematic which was the rgp lights and the 2 oled displays and the rest of teh pico pins and assigned the footprints for them from the libraries that i downloaded then I arranged some of the footprints like the key matrix and routing them which was a very defecult mission since it is my second tiem making a pcb. and took the write measurments for real life to make the pcb more accurate and more likely to be made in real life. so i checked by running a dcr on the pcb to check for designing errors or electric ones.

## Day 4 (4-5 hours) 15/7/2025
I arranged all the parts of the pcb and i saw my key board in the pcb and imagined how good it will be so i ran a dcr and I didn't find any errors except the ones for overlabing footprints. arringing the parts and the components and routing them was just a lot of work since y keyboard has 84 keys and 84 leds and 2 oled displays and 1 rp pico. all this component made the rounting more dificult but thank god i did it faster than i thought it would take. i exported my PCB as a step file to put it in the cad to test if it will fit in the real life or not. then i searched for the greb files and how to make ones and what are they used for and i decided to make it in the next day.

## Day 5 (1-2) 16/7/2025
after the long search about how to make a greb file and how to use it properly adn how to drill its files and how it works. i tested my grb file by putting it in the website of the parttener of the hack club in making the PCBs JLCpcb i tried to upload the file and it worked and i found that the leds that i will use is so cheap there so i conteued in the shiping steps until i reached the last page so i wint to chck the price and i put it in the BOM ot make it more complte. so i made the table as a csv file as you said and how are you said i followed some links that made me understant what was goning on.

## Day 6 (3-4) 19/7/2025
I began my 3D designing and made a simple bottom case with a good thickness and a huge triangle int the bottom to make the keyboard sloped with 6.5 deg which is the best angel for my hand and the one that i found it relaxing and charming. So it became one part (the bottom one). i made it fits by calculating the dimentions of the pcb from kicad and put it in onshape in making the shallow part in the how which you might livej so  i checked again to ensure they was identical and fit together then.

## Day 7 (2-3) 20/7/2025
I imported the dxr sketch for the top part and added a square for the OLED display and a hole I all this poured in having a good top part the could fit perfectly. The bottom part for the pico was standing on the floor of the second floore all this made my top part has a lot of work and i give it all my creativity. Then exported it and asimblied it with the bottom part to check if they are good and fitting together and they were. as shown in this photo the two parts are working with each other and fit together. so when i assimbly in the real life i will be much easier to do.

## Day 8 (3-4) 23/7/2025
I exported the pcb in step to put it in the cad and it wasn't that good enoghph and there was some bad dimentions that were made. so I change it and searched about the real size and compared it will the store and the cad and i found that i must change it. so i change it an it was butiful and inserted it in the whole pad assymbly and checked on every thing to make sure that every thing was good and working and if there any other problems  then i ecported the whole file And change all the things that wanted to be changed like the name size and font. then i made the BOM and organized the files in folders.

## Day 9 (1-2) 26/7/2025
I putted some detailes in the cad like the writing and adding some shapes, curves, text all this. and I changed the BOM for the last time making sure of the prices. on diffrent stores on the internet And took all the photos for the submition and in serted it in teh jornal file to document waht i did. i finnished the hole case making some parts out or it with 5 mm thickness 2 inside the case and 3 outside it so it will be soo good. and clearly this idea was loking good in the files.

## Day 10 ( less than 1 hour ) 27/7/2025
I checked on everything and submitted finally my keyboard.

## Day 11 (4 hours) 5/8/2025
i changed alot and submeted for the re-review üòç.
