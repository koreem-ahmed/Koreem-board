# The sloped keyboard by koreem ahmed 

## Total time 22-31

## Day 1 (3-4 hours) 8/7/2025
Today I began my search about the key-board and how to make it and the switches types and all the components of the key-board. I searched on ram electronics and flux (local stores in Egypt). I found that the perfect size for me is 75% key-boards so I sketched one like in the photo. so i made the layout and got the dxf and contenue planing for what i want to do.

## Day 2 (2-3 hours) 10/7/2025
I made a deep search of the most compatible libraries for kicad for the OLED display and the pico and the switches then I downloaded it ant made half the schematic which was the key matrix and some of the pico pins. also i searched a gin for the best 3d files to represent my work in the right way.

## Day 3 (3-4 hours) 12/7/2025
I completed the schematic and assigned the footprints for them then I arranged some of the footprints. to the

## Day 4 (4-5 hours) 15/7/2025
I arranged all the parts of the pcb and ran a dcr and I didn't find any errors except the ones for overlabing footprints. Then I wanted to insert RGB lights so I put them in the schematic and in the pcb.

## Day 5 (1-2) 16/7/2025
I searched how to make a grub file then tested it by putting it on JLCpcb to ship it and I took the price and put it in the BOM. so i mad ethe grup file and placed ot in the website of JLcpcb and i had a standerd price which i put in my BOM.

## Day 6 (3-4) 19/7/2025
I began my 3D designing and made a simple bottom case then added a slop to it. So it became one part (the bottom one). i made htis by calculating the dimentions of the pcb from kicad and put it in onshape to by identical and fit together then i made a triangle to make my keyboard with a 6.5 deg which will help my hands to wrinst and be relaxed when typing.

## Day 7 (2-3) 20/7/2025
I imported the dxr sketch for the top part and added a square for the OLED display and a hole I. The bottom part for the pico. Then exported it and asimblied it with the bottom part to check if they are good. And they were good. ans shown in this photo the two parts are working with each other and fit together.

## Day 8 (3-4) 23/7/2025
I exported the pcb in step to put it in the cad and it wasn't that good so I made it right. and inserted it in the whole pad assymbly and checked on every thing then i ecported the hole file And change all the things that wanted to be changed I. The BOM and organized the files in folders.

## Day 9 (1-2) 26/7/2025
I putted some detailes in the cad like the writing and adding some shapes and I changed the BOM for the last time making sure of the prices. And took all the photos for the submition and this day of the jornal and asked some friends about there openion in the cad and the pcb and the whole keyboard and they said it is good.
