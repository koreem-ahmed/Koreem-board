# The sloped keyboard by koreem ahmed 

## Total time 22-31

## Day 1 (3-4 hours) 8/7/2025
Today I began my search about the key-board and how to make it and the switches types and all the components of the key-board. I searched on ram electronics and flux (local stores in Egypt). I found that the perfect size for me is 75% key-boards so I sketched one like in the photo.

## Day 2 (2-3 hours) 10/7/2025
I made a deep search of the most compatible libraries for kicad for the OLED display and the pico and the switches then I downloaded it ant made half the schematic.

## Day 3 (3-4 hours) 12/7/2025

## Day 4 (4-5 hours) 15/7/2025
I arranged all the parts of the pcb and ran a dcr and I didn't find any errors. Then I wanted to put RGB lights so I put them in the schematic and added them in the schematic and in the pcb.

## Day 5 (1-2) 16/7/2025
I searched how to make a grub file then tested it by putting it on JLCpcb to ship it and I took the price and put it in the BOM.

## Day 6 (3-4) 19/7/2025
I began my 3D designing and made a simple bottom case then added a slop to it. So it became one part (the bottom one).

## Day 7 (2-3) 20/7/2025
I imported the dxr sketch for the top part and added a square for the OLED display and a hole I. The bottom part for the pico. Then exported it and asimblied it with the bottom part to check if they are good. And they were good.

## Day 8 (3-4) 23/7/2025
I exported the pcb in step to put it in the cad and it wasn't that good so I made it right. And change all the things that wanted to be changed I. The BOM and organized the files in folders.

## Day 9 (1-2) 26/7/2025
I putted some detailes in the cad like the writing and the shapes and I changed the BOM for the last time and checked the prices again. And took all the photos for the report and organized them.


## Day 10 ( less than 1 hour ) 27/7/2025
I checked on everything and submitted finally.
